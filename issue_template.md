## Feature Request: Script to Automatically Update GitHub Star Counts

### Description
Create a simple script that can be run periodically to update GitHub star counts in the project list. This would help keep star counts in the README up-to-date without requiring manual updates for each repository.

### Requirements
- Should build on the existing github-star-fetcher.js script
- Could take a list of repositories from the project listings
- Should output a report of repositories that need updating
- Keep things simple and minimal - no complex automation or GitHub Actions

### Use Case
When maintainers want to refresh star counts, they can run a single command that will identify which projects' star counts are outdated and suggest updates for them.

### Implementation Notes
- This is a follow-up to PR #1739 which added a simple star count fetcher
- The script should remain simple and focused on helping maintainers, not replacing them
